I was looking for a way to validate Facebook and Twitter user input and found relatively little information on it so I wrote these 2 little functions. Use this to parse a Facebook URL:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Abban/5816360.js?file=facebook-url-parse.php"></script>

And use this to parse a Twitter username:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Abban/5816360.js?file=twitter-username-parse.php"></script>

Hope this helps, I'm not 100% sure on the regex stuff so if you have any better methods let me know!
