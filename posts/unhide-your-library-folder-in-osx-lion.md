I just installed OSX Lion. One of the first things I noticed was different is that Apple have decided to hide the Library folder. This is a pretty stupid thing to do because anyone who uses Photoshop or wants to add fonts to their library will need it. You can however unhide it easily enough. All you need to do is type the following into Terminal:

<p class="noindent"><code>chflags nohidden ~/Library</code></p>
