Here's a simple function that you can add to your WordPress template to print out a Jigoshop cart amount, total price and link to the cart. It's useful if you want a small consistent button somewhere in your theme, such as in the header, to link the user easily to the full cart page. To use it simply paste the following into your themes functions.php file:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Abban/5816572.js?file=cart-button.php"></script>

And then put the following wherever you want the button to appear:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Abban/5816572.js?file=button-placement.php"></script>

The function takes 2 optional parameters, one for content before the output and one for content after. Enjoy.
