There ain't much info on the internet on getting a loading spinner working with Backbone. It's easy though! First go and create one over at <a href="http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/">spin.js</a>, then copy the following code into your html:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Abban/5816442.js?file=html.html"></script>

And this into your CSS:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Abban/5816442.js?file=css.css"></script>

And finally this into your js:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Abban/5816442.js?file=js.js"></script>

And bam, loading spinner that fires on all your backbone ajax calls. Of course this will work with any jQuery ajax framework too.
